In this guide I will be sharing with you all of the hardware and software I bought, created and wrote to build the Room Automation System

<b>Hardware:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Esp 32 NodeMCU (ESP32 DEVKITV1)</li>
  <li>5V power supply with barell jack and ofc a female jack</li>
  <li>Relay Module with as many relays you want!</li>
  <li>Vero board</li>
  <li>5V voltage regulator (7805)</li>
  <li>Soldering Stuff</li>
  <li>a brain, because I don't have one to write a good enough tutorial</li>
</ol>


<b>Software:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Setup your esp32 on micropython using google.</li>
  <li>Install Adafruit-Ampy using pip</li>
  <li>Install PuTTy</li>
  <li>Connect your Esp32 with your computer</li>
  <li>Open command prompt and run the command: mode <br>

  </li>
  <li>Using ampy put all of the following files in the following order:</li>
